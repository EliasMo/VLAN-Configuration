# VLAN-Configuration
## Project1 - Basic-VLAN-Segmentation 
Configuring VLANs on switches to segment a network, check connectivity and automate VLAN checks. 
VLANs are used in departments to secure and manage the traffic. 

Objective: Show VLAN isolation by creating separate broadcast domains.

Steps: 
  - Configure VLAN 10 and 20 on the switch
  - Assign Host1 to VLAN 10 and Host2 to VLAN 20 and connect them to the Switch
  - Use ping tests to show that Host 1 and 2 cannot communicate, illustrating VLAN segementation
